## Hi there üëã

Let me introduce myself‚Ä¶


### As a human

I'm a codeborn programmer in the 2nd generation[*](#father) from North-West of Russia. My birth town is Severodvinsk. This is a city near Arkhangelsk, Russian Los-Angeles :)

I love _Chineese tea_ (especially red varieties and GABA oolongs), milk coffee beverages, _craft beer_ (especially stouts, IPAs and milkshakes) and smoking a _hookah_. I like _comedies_ and _cartoons_, hiking, sightseeing and taking shots of interesting places. What about music? I like Russian _rave_ (GSPD, CMH, Dead Blonde), _rap_ (dom!No, playingtheangel, RAY-D, aikko), _pop punk_ (–ó–ê–í–¢–†–ê –ë–†–û–®–£, ONEDAY, Drug –¢–≤–æ–µ–π –¢—ë–ª–∫–∏).

I'm very inquisitive person since childhood and interested in _computer science, physics, chemistry and biology_. However, I don't like olympiads and contests.

Currently, I'm in a state of war with my own demons and anxiety-depressive disorder, trying to become a normal person, accepted by society.

_<p id="father">* My father had been developing video games in Basic and assembler for ZX Spectrum in 1990s.</p>_


### As a worker, software developer and engineer

My first computer program was a simple text quest written in Blitz Basic. Unfortunately, this project is lost now. However, I wrote [another similar quest](https://kozalo.blog/#post-1323882862) in Delphi later (it's in Russian). I still love _Borland Delphi 7_ for such great simplicity of creating forms (windows) and handlers. Thus, it's not surprising I wrote many programs in _Visual C#_ during university studying.

Nevertheless, I'm always been fascinated by low levels of computer machinery. I tried to learn _C++_ (yeah, for 21 days, reading the famous book). Unsuccessfully, though (however, I wrote a [firmware](https://kozalo.blog/#post-1519392768) for Arduino in plain _C_ later). I've learnt some basics of assembly language and OS architecture with an awesome [series of articles](https://bitfry.narod.ru/) written by Bitfry.

Later I knew about _Python_ and I love its power and simplicity for writing scripts[*](#linux), Telegram bots (e.g. [@textUtilsBot](https://github.com/kozalosev/textUtilsBot) and [@kozRandBot](https://github.com/kozalosev/kozRandBot)) and even [games](https://kozalo.blog/#post-1497775199)!

_<p id="linux">* At this period, I was actively exploring and configuring Linux distros. Now I'm using Windows and MacOS and I hate 'perdoling' (this is a term in Russian, meaning the love of junior IT engineers to build a Linux system from scratch or modify a standard distribution completely).</p>_

Nonetheless, my official professional career, outside personal pet projects, is closely tight with _Java_ and a whole ecosystem around its virtual machine. I was involved in a group of people dreaming about creation of a personal assistant app before it became possible nowadays due to the rapid evolvement of neural networks. We were working on the [DeskChan](https://github.com/DeskChan/DeskChan/) project ‚Äî a Java application suggesting a theoretically endless set of features by extending it with plugins written in any JVM compatible language like _Kotlin_, _Groovy_, Scala, _Jython_, Closure, etc.

The next stage in my life and career is relocation to Moscow and working for the largest bank of the country ‚Äî from a junior software engineer to team lead. It took 3.5 years.

The last year I had decided to step away from virtual machines and interpreted languages and go deeper into system programming languages like _Go_ üíî and _Rust_ ‚ù§Ô∏è. Also, I was getting in touch with _PostgreSQL_ (my previous experience with RDBMS was with MySQL and Oracle), _Prometheus_, _Loki_, _Grafana_, _protobuf_, _gRPC_.

Shortly speaking, I would describe my preferences as:

‚ù§Ô∏è **I love**:
* strongly statically typed and functional languages like Rust, Kotlin, Java, Python with type hints as an exception for prototypes and small programs;
* Windows, MacOS, Linux on servers and IT infrastructure;
* crypto and finances, blockchain and distributed systems in general;
* scientists.

üíî **I don't** really **like**:
* frontend,
* Go,
* Linux on desktops,
* puzzlers on algorithms or bytefucking,
* ~~normies~~.


## My currently active projects

Telegram bots:
* ‚≠êÔ∏è [@SadFavBot](https://github.com/kozalosev/SadFavBot) ‚Äî favorites bot, written in _Go_;
* üó∫ [@LocPlaceBot](https://github.com/kozalosev/LocPlaceBot) ‚Äî inline bot, written in _Rust_, that allows you to search for some place and send its coordinates as a location;
* üçÜ [@DickGrowerBot](https://github.com/kozalosev/DickGrowerBot) ‚Äî game bot, written in _Rust_, to measure and compare your Big Ben with friends' ones;
* üî§ [@textUtilsBot](https://github.com/kozalosev/textUtilsBot) ‚Äî simple bot, written in _Python 3_, that has some useful handlers of inline queries to make text conversions;
